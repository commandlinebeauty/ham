==================

[TOC]

The Html Ascii Markup (HAM) library provides a simple framework for building
user interfaces from ASCII boxes.

This documentation has been generated by making use of Doxygen @cite doxygen.

Installation	{#install}
============

Dependencies	{#dependencies}
------------

HAM depends on the following programs and libraries available in standard repositories:

- A webserver, e.g., Apache
- PHP5
- GNU make (for developer documentation)
- bibtex (for developer documentation)
- doxygen (for developer documentation)
- links2 (optional text browser)

On Ubuntu systems the following command should install
most of the required dependencies:

	sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 make doxygen links2

## Clone the HAM git repository {#clone} ##

	git clone TODO

## Test HAM installation (recommended) ##

Link the user documentation to your web directory and access it from your
favorite browser, for example:

	ln -s ham /var/www/html/ham
	links2 http://localhost/ham

## Build the developer documentation (optional) ##

Enter the newly cloned local copy and build the documentation:

	cd ham && make doc
