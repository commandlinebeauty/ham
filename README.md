[TOC]

The Html Ascii Markup (HAM) library provides a simple framework for building
user interfaces from ASCII boxes.

This documentation has been generated by making use of Doxygen @cite doxygen.

Installation	{#install}
============

You can skip the following steps and go directly to the [usage section](#usage)
if you do not intend to test the HAM library locally or build the developer
documentation yourself.

## Dependencies	{#dependencies}

HAM depends on the following programs and libraries available in standard repositories:

- A webserver, e.g., Apache
- PHP5
- GNU make (for developer documentation)
- bibtex (for developer documentation)
- doxygen (for developer documentation)
- links2 (optional text browser)

On Ubuntu systems the following command should install
most of the required dependencies:

	sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 make doxygen links2

## Clone HAM repository {#clone} ##

	cd
	git clone http://www.commandlinebeauty.com/git/ham.git

The link might redirect you to a GitHub @cite github repository.

## Test Installation (recommended) {#test} ##

Link the user documentation to your web directory and access it from your
favorite browser, for example:

	ln -s ham /var/www/html/ham
	links2 http://localhost/ham/doc

## Developer Documentation (optional) {#devdoc} ##

Enter the newly cloned local copy and build the developer documentation:

	cd ham && make doc

Usage                   {#usage}
=====

Include the ham.php file and render the main layout from your ASCII file with
your desired options, e.g., your index.php might look like this:

```php
<?php

	include '~/ham/src/ham.php';

	$ham = new ham(file_get_contents('myInterface.txt'),
		array(
			//! Set page title
			'title' => 'My Webinterface',
		)
	);

	echo $ham->render();
```

Configuration          {#config}
=============

See the defaults set in config.php for a complete list of all configuration
options. These are the most common ones:

At the moment this is an one-man project and I need to make a living.

About			{#about}
=====

This Html Ascii Markup parser has been developed from a need of a framework for
creating simple user interfaces in very short time. In particular, I needed a
simple interface for configuring my RaspberryPi VPN bridge (see
http://www.commandlinebeauty.com/projects/rpi).
